This project has been a long time in the making. With only a dev team, composed of 2-3 members, I have been able to wrap the entire MangaSee123 manga reading website in a single, easy to use api. 
The api is made using Flask and mainly written using raw python. I recently noticed a huge increase in my understanding and comprehension, so I wrote these clients mainly myself with the help of some close niggas.
I understand that some of you guys may not be as smart as me, which is completely understandable. So i've made this api/client as comprehensible and easy to understand as possible.
The implementation should be easy. The api itself will most likely have fully encrypted communication both ways in the future, until then, the source will be completely private and the api will be paid/private access.
I may release the api in the future so everyone can host their own copy locally. 

I need a team of python/js/golang/c# devs.

if you know <python/js/golang/c#> ---> message me on discord or telegram.
